# DocToc Documentation

This repository is a complete Jekyll project which serves as documentation for [DocToc](https://github.com/nounch/doctoc). Of course, it uses DocToc itself to generate the documentation and all its navigation elements.

# Usage

The documentation itself should always be edited in the Jekyll project on `master`. The published version goes to `gh-pages` as output of running `jekyll build` on `master`. This means there is no Jekyll project in `gh-pages` since GitHub Pages does not allow to run plugins.

To run Jekyll locally do this:

```
jekyll serve --watch --port 8002
```

Since GitHub Pages prepends the project name to every page as a base URL, pages with navigation elements have a HTML `base` tag which uses `site.baseurl` as `href`. The base URL is configured in `_config.yml` as `baseurl`. So all relative links generated by DocToc point to a valid URL. Note: Links to assets have to be either relative or they have to explicitely include `site.baseurl`.

If you think this is ugly, you may be right, but you should also have a look at [this](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/332).
